# DEPRECATED as of September 2, 2022

The ArgoCD repository now houses all of the scripts we use for deployment.
This repository is not to be used, but is being left open for a bit. 
Once it is determined not to be of use any more, it will be archived.

# ArgoCD Administration

This repo contains scripts that aid in the administration of the ArgoCD
configuration stored in [argocd-csc](https://github.com/lsst-ts/argocd-csc).
